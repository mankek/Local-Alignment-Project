This holds an R Shiny application in the folder Local_Alignment for generating a local alignment matrix for two user-input DNA sequences and correlating scores to colors (using a heatmap visualization).

Currently, the application is very rudimentary with no input validation and a very dense backend that I will be striving to streamline.

Operation is very simple once the application is cloned locally; simply run it using RStudio or the 


	R -e shiny::runApp()

command in your console.

The Scripts folder holds R scripts that I used for development of the functionality of the application and for future features.
